var jun = function moment("2022-06-05T12:00:00Z");
console.log (currentTime)

// WHEN I scroll down
// THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

// WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
// THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future


// WHEN I click into a timeblock
// THEN I can enter an event

// WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
// THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

// WHEN I refresh the page
// THEN the saved events persist
